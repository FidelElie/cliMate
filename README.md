# CliMate
A different way of creating command line applications.

## Introduction

CliMate *(pronounced cli-mate or c-l-i-mate)* is a utility for creating robust and easily extensible command line applications. It follows different procedures to the usual command line application and offers its own unique features by the use of Python and JSON. The utility focusses on giving the user choice, whether they want to enter commands and arguments through a normal familiar interface or through a more modern user friendly approach.

## Pre-requisites

Python 3 is required for use of CliMate.

## Installation

```pip install climate```
